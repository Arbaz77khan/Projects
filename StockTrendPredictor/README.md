# 📈 Stock Trend Predictor

### 🚀 Goal: Predict 7-day stock trend using Machine Learning & Deploy it as a Web App

---

## 🧾 Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to build a system that predicts whether the stock price for the next 7 days will go **Up**, **Down**, or **Hold**, based on the past 1 year of daily trading data. The solution will also estimate a price range and provide a confidence score for each prediction.

This tool is meant to assist investors in short-term trading decisions by providing smart, data-driven insights via a simple web interface.

## 🎯 Project Scope

- Predict **Buy / Sell / Hold** signals
- Predict **price range** for next 7 days
- Display **confidence score** with each prediction
- Support **multi-stock** forecasting (future version)
- Build a clean **web-based app** for viewing predictions
- Prepare project like an **industry-grade DS project** (testing, feedback, bug tracking, documentation)
